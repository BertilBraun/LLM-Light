# Coding Standards

## Type Annotations

All functions must have full type annotations on parameters and return types. No exceptions.

```python
# correct
async def build_contract(request: TaskRequest) -> TaskContract: ...

# wrong
async def build_contract(request, contract_type="bugfix"): ...
```

### Generic structured output

When a function produces a type determined by a caller-supplied type, use a TypeVar:

```python
from typing import TypeVar
from pydantic import BaseModel

T = TypeVar("T", bound=BaseModel)

async def generate_structured(
    self,
    messages: list[Message],
    output_type: type[T],
) -> T:
    ...
```

The return type is always the concrete type the caller passed in — never `BaseModel` or `Any`.

---

## Trust Typed Provider APIs

Use precise third-party SDK types in protocols, helper signatures, and return values. Let those types remove impossible branches.

```python
# correct
from openai.types.chat import ChatCompletion, ParsedChatCompletion

def _extract_parsed(response: ParsedChatCompletion[T]) -> T: ...

# wrong
def _extract_parsed(response: object, output_type: type[T]) -> T:
    if isinstance(response, dict):
        ...
```

Do not add broad `object`, `Any`, `dict`, `getattr`, or `isinstance` fallbacks for shapes that the SDK type already guarantees. If a provider violates its declared type, let the boundary fail clearly instead of turning the client into a permissive parser.

---

## Test Doubles Stay Out of Production Code

Production modules must not contain fake-mode branches, canned LLM responses, fake clients, or test fixtures. Use dependency injection and test-local fakes instead.

```python
# correct
llm_client = LLMClient(async_openai_client=fake_openai_client)

# wrong
if os.getenv("LLM_FAKE_MODE") == "1":
    return '{"status":"success"}'
```

Temporary smoke harnesses may have explicit fake implementations, but they must live under `tests/`, `examples/`, or an evaluation harness module, not in the production client.

---

## No String Keys

Never use raw dicts or string key access to pass structured data between functions. Always use a dataclass, Pydantic model, or NamedTuple.

```python
# correct
@dataclass
class WorkerResult:
    status: WorkerStatus
    patch_id: str
    diff_summary: str
    tests_run: list[str]
    test_results: list[TestResult]
    discovered_issues: list[str]
    confidence: Confidence
    replan_suggestion: str | None

# wrong
result = {
    "status": "success",
    "patch_id": "abc",
    ...
}
```

This applies to: activity inputs/outputs, workflow inputs/outputs, LLM structured outputs, tool inputs/outputs, config, event payloads.

---

## Enums over Literal Strings

Use `enum.Enum` (or `enum.StrEnum` for serialization compatibility) for any value that belongs to a fixed set.

```python
class WorkerStatus(StrEnum):
    SUCCESS = "success"
    FAILED = "failed"
    BLOCKED = "blocked"
    NEEDS_REPLAN = "needs_replan"

class Confidence(StrEnum):
    LOW = "low"
    MEDIUM = "medium"
    HIGH = "high"
```

---

## Dataclasses and Pydantic

- Use `@dataclass` for internal, non-serialized data structures.
- Use `pydantic.BaseModel` for anything that crosses a serialization boundary: LLM structured outputs, Temporal-Light activity inputs/outputs, HTTP payloads.
- All Pydantic models use `model_config = ConfigDict(frozen=True)` unless mutation is explicitly needed.

### LLM Structured Outputs

- Model LLM responses with Pydantic models, not raw dictionaries or nullable catch-all payloads.
- Add `Field(description=...)` to LLM-facing fields when the model needs parameter guidance.
- Prefer tagged unions for tool-call variants so each tool exposes only its own parameters.
- Do not expose irrelevant nullable fields to the model.

---

## No Abbreviations

Full descriptive names everywhere. No `ctx`, `cfg`, `req`, `res`, `msg`, `impl`, `fn`, `cb`, `tmp`, `val`.

```python
# correct
workflow_context, model_configuration, task_request, llm_response

# wrong
ctx, cfg, req, res
```

---

## Short Files and Single-Responsibility Functions

Keep files and functions focused on one clear responsibility. A function should do one job at one level of abstraction; if it mixes orchestration, validation, data transformation, model calls, logging, persistence, plotting, and metric aggregation, split those concerns into named helpers or small collaborating modules.

Prefer extracting code when any of these are true:

- The function is difficult to summarize in one sentence.
- The function contains multiple phases separated only by comments or blank lines.
- Local variables are reused across unrelated steps.
- The same function owns setup, execution, evaluation, and reporting.
- A reader must scroll substantially to understand the control flow.

Files should follow the same rule: one module should group related behavior, not become a dumping ground for every helper used by a workflow. When a workflow is naturally long, keep the public entry point as a readable orchestration layer and move the details into private helpers, typed data structures, or dedicated modules.

---

## No silent defaults

Never use default parameter values that could hide bugs. All parameters must be explicitly passed by the caller - do not rely on defaults to fill in missing values.

```python
# correct
def create_task(request: TaskRequest) -> TaskContract: ...
# wrong
def create_task(request: TaskRequest, contract_type="bugfix") -> TaskContract: ...

#correct
important_value = config.get("important_value")
if important_value is None:
    raise ValueError("important_value is required in config")
# wrong
important_value = config.get("important_value", "default_value")
```

---

## No Dynamic Attribute Access - EVER

Never use `getattr`, `setattr`, `hasattr`, or any form of dynamic attribute access. Always use explicit attributes defined on a class or dataclass. If you find yourself needing dynamic attribute access, it's a sign that your data structure should be redesigned.

---

## Dependencies

Once dependencies are added, they may be assumed to be present and do not require defensive checks or fallbacks.

```python
# correct
from httpx import AsyncClient

# wrong
try:
    import httpx
except ImportError:
    class AsyncClient:
        def __init__(*args, **kwargs):
            raise ImportError("httpx is required for AsyncClient")
```

---

## Imports

All imports go at the top of the module. Never import inside a function, a `try/except` block, or a `match` case.

Use the imported type in annotations — never fall back to `object` when the real type is available.

```python
# correct
import docker

def _docker_client() -> docker.DockerClient:
    return docker.from_env()

# wrong
def _docker_client() -> object:
    import docker
    return docker.from_env()
```

---

## match/case over isinstance chains

Use `match/case` for branching on types instead of `isinstance` chains. This is more concise, readable, and extensible. The match statement also provides exhaustiveness checking, so if a new type is added to the union, you'll get a warning to handle it. But - keep in mind, that this should also only be used sparingly, when the design genuinely calls for branching on multiple types. If you find yourself needing to use `match/case` frequently, it may be a sign that your design could be improved by using polymorphism or a more explicit data structure instead of a union of many types.

```python
# correct
match node:
    case FunctionDefinition(name=name):
        ...
    case ClassDefinition(name=name):
        ...

# wrong
if isinstance(node, FunctionDefinition):
    ...
elif isinstance(node, ClassDefinition):
    ...
```

---

## Error Handling

- `assert` for internal invariants that signal bugs.
- `raise ValueError` for invalid inputs at system boundaries.
- No defensive checks for things that cannot happen given the type system.

---

## Comments

No comments unless the WHY is non-obvious. Never describe what the code does. One line maximum.

---

## Formatting

Run `ruff format` and `ruff check --fix` before any commit. All warnings must be resolved.

---

## Testing

- Parametrize similar cases with `@pytest.mark.parametrize`.
- Integration tests that require external services (Docker, Temporal-Light, Postgres) are marked `@pytest.mark.integration` and skipped unless the relevant env vars are set.

---

## Backwards Compatibility

In general, the projects are personal research projects, not libraries, so backwards compatibility is not a concern. Feel free to refactor and break things as needed to keep the code clean and maintainable. Most of the time preserving a function signature if we're changing/adding parameters is unnecessary.

---

## Python Version

Target Python 3.10+. Use `match/case`, `X | Y` union syntax.
